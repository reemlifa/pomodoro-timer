 
i've had this idea swimming around in my head for a bit but haven't done anything to prep for it. 

today i just made a shitty wireframe of what i what the front main side to look like in canva, but i actually have to design it in cad (once I finish hackpad) and make it look useable lol 
will probably do some more research on the parts i may need to make this work and stimulate it in tinkercad! 

right now my thoughts on a bom:
- arduino nano: needs to be tiny so it can fit in the case
- oled display (not sure the size yet, we'll figure that out later)
- 5 tiny push buttons (for each of the options!)
- usb cable (probably going to make the back of the tomato have a hole so that the wire can go through)
- buzzers or vibration motor??? don't know how to use them yet
- breadboard and mtf wires (have a bunch of mtf wires, might need a larger breadboard though)
